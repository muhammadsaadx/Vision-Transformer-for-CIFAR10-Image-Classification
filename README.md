# Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification. The model leverages the Transformer architecture, originally designed for NLP, and applies it to computer vision tasks by treating image patches as tokens.

## Features
- Implements the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification.
- Uses PyTorch and Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- Processes images as sequences of patches instead of using traditional convolutional layers.
- Trains on a standard image classification dataset.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a standard image classification dataset such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. Images are preprocessed by:
- Resizing to a fixed resolution.
- Splitting into non-overlapping patches.
- Flattening and embedding patches into token representations.

## Model Architecture
### Vision Transformer (ViT)
The Vision Transformer model follows the structure introduced in the paper *An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale* by Dosovitskiy et al. It consists of:
- **Image Patch Embedding**: The input image is divided into fixed-size patches, which are linearly projected into embedding vectors.
- **Positional Encoding**: Since Transformers do not have a built-in sense of order, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention**: Enables the model to capture relationships between different patches in an image.
- **Feedforward Network**: A series of fully connected layers with activation functions for feature extraction.
- **Classification Head**: A final MLP layer that produces the class probabilities.

## Training Process
The training pipeline consists of:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and normalize image dataset.
   - Convert images into patch embeddings.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Cross-entropy loss is used for classification.
   - The Adam optimizer with weight decay is applied for optimization.
   - Training is performed on a GPU for accelerated computation.
3. **Validation & Evaluation**:
   - Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
   - Predictions are compared with ground truth labels.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified images.
- **Loss Curves**: Analyzes the training and validation loss trends over epochs.

## Usage
Once trained, the model can classify images by:
- Taking an input image and converting it into patches.
- Passing the patches through the Transformer encoder.
- Outputting the predicted class label.
